            Alright. To what position?
            Please specify all 3 coordinates of the new position in the following format:
            x is (position on x-axis) y is (position on y-axis) z is (position on z-axis)

            Please specify the position in my desired format for me to process it.
            Specify all 3 coordinates of the new position in the following format:
            x is (position on x-axis) y is (position on y-axis) z is (position on z-axis)
            Have a look at the console for the format again.
            Note the white spaces and ignore the brackets.
