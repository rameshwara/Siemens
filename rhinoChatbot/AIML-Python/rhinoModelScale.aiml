            Alright. Please state by what factor do you want to make the sphere smaller or bigger in the following format:
            (bigger or smaller) by (scaling value) factor.
            For example: bigger by factor 2.
            Have a look at the console for the format and example.

            Please specify the scaling factor in my desired format for me to process it. And that is,
            (bigger or smaller) by (scaling value) factor.
            For example: bigger by factor 5.
            Have a look at the console for the format and example.
            My skills are limited to process only integer values.
